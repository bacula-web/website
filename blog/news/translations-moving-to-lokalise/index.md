Translations will have a new "home" soon

<!-- truncate -->

Dear community users, this is an **important change** in Bacula-Web project.

### What will happen ?

Please note that Bacula-Web project translations are moving from [Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/bacula-web/bacula-web/) to Lokalise

### Why ?

In the context of the ongoing project source refactoring, I've found out that Lokalise does offer a
much better features and it eases translations process for both developers and end-users.

It is also well integrated in the [PHP framework](https://symfony.com) I'm actually using for next Bacula-Web major release.

### Impact

I took all the precautions to not lose any work done by translators in [Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/bacula-web/bacula-web/), so there won't be any impact on actual translations done in the past.

### When this will it be effective ?

Once next major release is published (no eta yet but you should expect it in few weeks)

### How to get help ?

By using [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/bacula-web/bacula-web/discussions), or sending an email to [hello@bacula-web.org](mailto:hello@bacula-web.org)

### Where is the updated translator guide ?

I'm actually working on it, but it's not ready to be published yet.

If you have any question or feedback, feel free to contact me by using GitHub discussion or by email (see above)

> Thanks for using and support Bacula-Web project

Best,

Davide
