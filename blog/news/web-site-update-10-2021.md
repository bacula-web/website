Here is a quick update about Bacula-Web project website

<!-- truncate -->

Since July 2021, Bacula-Web website has been moved from [Jekyll](https://jekyll.rb) to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

I took the decision to move from Jekyll as I wasn't really happy with it and found that Hugo is much easier to maintain and give me more time to focus on other aspects of Bacula-Web project, like new releases and bugfixes :).

I'm still working hard to import old content which used to be available while the website was running on WordPress, I'll try to update current website asap.

As [Bacula-Web Github issues](https://github.com/bacula-web/bacula-web/issues) refer to several bug reports/feature requests mentioned in the previous MantisBT, I have in my "TODO" list a task to bring back Mantis bug tracker, but it will be in read-only mode only. I'll keep the community updated soon.

Hope you'll enjoy it !
