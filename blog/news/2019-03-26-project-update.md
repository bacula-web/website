Dear all,

I'd like to inform you that really soon, bugs and feature request tracking will be done using GitHub issues.

<!--truncate-->

### Why ?

* Pull requests and issues will be in a single place (ease community users contribution)
* Don't waste my time with managing/upgrading/fixing current bug tracker, I do prefer spending my time on code fixing and new features ;)
* No need to ask people to register on GitHub + Mantis bug tracker, you'll have access to everything using a single account
* Current bug tracker lacks some functionalities like Git repo integration, etc.

### What will happen ?

Here's below what will happen ...

* Current Mantis bug tracker will be switched to **read only** and will still be available to [https://bugs-archive.bacula-web.org](https://bugs-archive.bacula-web.org)
* GitHub issues will be enabled on [Bacula-Web project](https://github.com/bacula-web/bacula-web) on GitHub.
* Bacula-Web [documentation](https://www.bacula-web.org/docs) and website will be updated accordingly.
* The project roadmap which was available [here](https://bugs.bacula-web.org/roadmap_page.php) will be available at [Bacula-Web project on GitHub](https://github.com/bacula-web/bacula-web/projects)
* Incomplete feature(s) or unfixed bugs will be recreated on [GitHub project](https://github.com/bacula-web/bacula-web/issues)

More information might come later

Shall you have any questions / remarks, feel free to add a comment to this post.

Thanks for using and supporting Bacula-Web project.

Davide
