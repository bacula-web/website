I'm really pleased to announce that Bacula-Web 8.0.1 has been released.

<!--truncate-->

This is a minor bug fix release which only address a bug in the documentation.

Unless you're running version older than version 8.0.0, you don't need to update Bacula-Web on your side.

But if you're running version 7.4.0 or even older, I'd strongly recommend to upgrade to latest version.
