I'm pleased to announce that Bacula-Web 9.1.0 has been released.

This is a minor feature and maintenance release.

This release brings support for Bacula-Web setup in sub-folder (using Apache alias) and fixes a couple of issues.

For more details, the [release notes](https://github.com/bacula-web/bacula-web/releases/tag/v9.1.0) is available on GitHub.

### Important note

Kind reminder, since release v8.6.0, Apache, Nginx or Lighttpd document root folder muse be set as below

``` shell
WEB_SERVER_ROOT/bacula-web/public
```

> In this example, you can replace WEB_SERVER_ROOT by /var/www/html (adapt to your environment

As usual, I strongly encourage everyone to upgrade to the latest release.
