I'm pleased to announce that Bacula-Web 8.9.0 has been released.

<!-- truncate -->

This release includes several bugfixes, and a minor feature.  

Please also note that it address a security issue with Smarty PHP template engine. Upgrading to latest version is highly recommended !

For more details, the [release notes](https://github.com/bacula-web/bacula-web/releases/tag/v8.9.0) is available on GitHub.

### Important note

Kind reminder, since release v8.6.0, Apache, Nginx or Lighttpd document root folder muse be set as below

``` shell
WEB_SERVER_ROOT/bacula-web/public
```

> In this example, you can replace WEB_SERVER_ROOT by /var/www/html (adapt to your environment

As usual, I strongly encourage everyone to upgrade to the latest release.

Please note that I've added some informations related to security in the [security](https://docs.bacula-web.org/en/latest/01_about/security.html) chapter of the documentation
