I'm really pleased to announce that Bacula-Web 8.2.0 has been released.

<!--truncate-->

This is a minor feature and bug fix release.

:::info[Important note]
Please note that next Bacula-Web release will remove support for PHP 5.6.
As stated on [PHP.net website](https://secure.php.net/supported-versions.php), PHP version 5.6 and prior has run out of support.
So for the sake of security, I encourage everyone to upgrade PHP **at least to version 7.1**.
