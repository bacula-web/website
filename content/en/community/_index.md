## Why sponsoring this project

Bacula-Web is a web based tool written in PHP which provides a summarized view of your Bacula backup infrastructure.

Metrics and informations displayed in Bacula-Web are taken from Bacula catalog database, no need to setup bconsole, bvfs, etc.

In addition, the access to the database is made read-only, so your Bacula catalog database remains safe :)

It is distributed under [GPL 2.0 license](https://github.com/bacula-web/bacula-web/blob/master/LICENSE).

By sponsoring this project, you help encourage the efforts, as well as the development of new features.
